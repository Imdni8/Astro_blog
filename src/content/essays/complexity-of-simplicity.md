We often hear that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. But what makes something truly simple? Let's peel back the layers of this paradox.

## Layer 1: The Surface
At first glance, simplicity seems straightforward - fewer parts, cleaner design, minimal complexity. But this surface-level understanding barely scratches the surface.

## Layer 2: The Trade-offs
Every simplification comes with trade-offs. When we remove complexity from one area, it often emerges elsewhere. A "simple" product might require a complex manufacturing process.

## Layer 3: The Context
What's simple in one context might be complex in another. A smartphone's interface is "simple" for digital natives but potentially bewildering for others.

## Core Understanding
True simplicity isn't about having less - it's about maximizing clarity while minimizing complexity.
