        <p>Hi, I'm Tousif. I build things and write about them. Sometimes I write about other things too.</p>
        
        <p>This site is my digital gardenâ€”a space where I cultivate ideas and share my work. It's deliberately minimal, focusing on content over styling.</p>
        
        <p>You'll find:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Builds: Technical projects and things I've created</li>
            <li>Ideas: Thoughts and observations about technology and society</li>
            <li>Onions: Deep dives into complex topics, peeling back layers</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet.</p>
